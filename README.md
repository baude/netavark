# netavark: A container network stack
 d;saolkjdls;kjasd;lkjdas 
Netavark is a rust based network stack for containers.  It is being designed
to work with [Podman](https://github.com/containers/podman) but is also applicable
for other OCI container management applications.

## Overview and scope

Netavark is capable of the following given the proper JSON input:
* Create, manage, and destroy network interfaces including bridge and macvlan
* Configure firewall (NAT) and port mapping rules
* Support IPv4 and IPv6

As this project is in very early development, we will add more capabilities in
the near future.
